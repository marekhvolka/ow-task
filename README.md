# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

To run this project, just run `npm run dev`. The main content is at `/titles`, I left the homepage empty intentionally.

To run the tests, just run `npm run test`

For Google Maps there is a token needed, you can set it as a ENV variable called `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
